# NAG Spark

These are a collection of examples for using the NAG Library on Apache Spark. Current NAG-Spark implemetations are in Java and include the following functionality:
 - Linear Regression (using direct solvers)
 - Simple Statistical Calculations (mean, sd, skewness, kurtosis)
 - Pearson Correlation 
 - Quantile Analysis

Coming Soon
- Linear Regression (w/constraints on variables)
- Logistic Regression (w/constraints on variables)
- Sampled K-means
- ???

### Why use a commercial numerical library on Spark?
- Performance
- Support
- Quality
- Documentation

### The NAG Library
Produced by experts for use in a variety of applications, the NAG Library is the largest commercially available collection of numerical and statistical algorithms in the world. With over 1,600 tried and tested routines that are both flexible and portable it remains at the core of thousands of programs and applications spanning the globe.

NAG Functionality includes
 - Optimization (Linear, Quadratic, Nonlinear, and Least-Squares Solvers)
 - Correlation and Regression Analysis
 - Statistics
 - Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations
 - Curve and Surface Fitting
 - Random Number Generation

### About NAG
The Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) is dedicated to applying its expertise in numerical engineering, to delivering high-quality computational software and high performance computing services. For four decades NAG experts have worked closely with world-leading researchers in academia and industry to create powerful, reliable and flexible software which today is relied on by tens of thousands of individual users, as well as numerous independent software vendors. As a not for profit company, NAG reinvests any surpluses on the research and development of its products and services, its staff and fostering new numerical and scientific talent.
